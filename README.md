### **Project: Stock Picker**

### **Introduction:**
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

This project is part of The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby Programming [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/stock-picker).
